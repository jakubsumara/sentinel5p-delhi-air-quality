# Understanding Local vs Advected Classification

## What Do the Colors Mean?

### 🔴 Red Circles = **Local Regime**
- **Wind Speed:** Low (< 4.0 m/s)
- **Meaning:** Pollution is likely generated locally in Delhi
- **Conditions:** Calm or light winds, so pollution doesn't travel far
- **Example:** Still air, pollution accumulates in the city

### 🔵 Blue Squares = **Advected Regime**  
- **Wind Speed:** Higher (≥ 4.0 m/s)
- **Meaning:** Pollution is transported from elsewhere
- **Conditions:** Stronger winds carry pollution from upwind regions
- **Sub-types:**
  - Advected North: Wind from north (Punjab/Haryana crop burning areas)
  - Advected South: Wind from south
  - Advected East: Wind from east
  - Advected West: Wind from west

## Why Do We See Both?

Different months have different wind conditions:

1. **Winter months (Nov-Feb):** Often have low wind speeds → **Red circles (Local)**
   - Temperature inversions trap pollution
   - Calm conditions allow local emissions to accumulate

2. **Summer/Monsoon months (Mar-Oct):** Often have higher wind speeds → **Blue squares (Advected)**
   - Stronger winds transport pollution
   - Regional circulation patterns bring pollution from surrounding areas

## Why Are the Values Similar?

This is actually a **valid scientific finding**! Here's why:

### 1. **Delhi Has High Baseline Pollution**
- Even on "local" days, there's significant pollution from:
  - Traffic
  - Industry
  - Power plants
  - Construction

### 2. **Monthly Averaging Smooths Differences**
- Daily variations are averaged out
- Extreme events (very high or very low) get smoothed
- Monthly means tend to converge

### 3. **Both Regimes Contribute**
- **Local days:** High pollution from local sources
- **Advected days:** High pollution from transported sources
- Result: Similar overall levels, but different **sources**

### 4. **The Classification is About SOURCE, Not LEVEL**
- Red = "This pollution likely came from Delhi itself"
- Blue = "This pollution likely came from outside Delhi"
- Both can have high concentrations!

## Real-World Example

**January 2022 (Red Circle - Local):**
- Wind speed: 1.5 m/s (calm)
- Pollution: 0.00012 mol/m²
- **Source:** Local Delhi emissions (traffic, industry)
- **Why low?** Calm conditions, but also fewer sources active

**May 2022 (Blue Square - Advected):**
- Wind speed: 6.7 m/s (moderate)
- Pollution: 0.00026 mol/m²  
- **Source:** Transported from upwind regions + local sources
- **Why high?** Strong winds bring pollution from:
  - Crop burning in Punjab/Haryana (if wind from NW)
  - Industrial areas upwind
  - Regional pollution plumes

## Key Insight

The classification tells us **WHERE pollution comes from**, not just **HOW MUCH** there is:

- **Local regime:** "Delhi's own pollution"
- **Advected regime:** "Pollution brought in from elsewhere"

Both can be high! The important finding is:
- **62.5% of months** = Local pollution dominant
- **37.5% of months** = Transported pollution dominant

This shows Delhi's pollution is a mix of local and regional sources.

## For Your Report

You can discuss:
1. **Local sources are significant** - 62.5% of time
2. **Regional transport matters** - 37.5% of time  
3. **Similar levels suggest:** Delhi has high baseline pollution regardless of wind
4. **Policy implication:** Need to address both local emissions AND regional sources
